# Floating Disk Tricks
Defensive Disk							KEY:Floating Disk Trick ~ Defensive Disk			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																		DESC:While riding atop your floating disk with at least one hand free, you can spend a move action to grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your floating disk grants you the benefits of the spell shield. If you are already under the effects of the shield spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell’s shield bonus by 1 until the beginning of your next turn.

Disk Rider								KEY:Floating Disk Trick ~ Disk Rider				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																		DESC:You can ride atop any floating disk you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within the Astral Plane—the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast floating disk, you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:62
Drifting Defense						KEY:Floating Disk Trick ~ Drifting Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																		DESC:Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you can activate the defensive disk trick as a free action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:62
Expanded Disk							KEY:Floating Disk Trick ~ Expanded Disk				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																		DESC:If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger floating disk capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature). Once created, a disk augmented with this trick will always support the weight of you and your personal gear, even if this combined mass exceeds the disk’s capacity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:62
Force Check								KEY:Floating Disk Trick ~ Force Check				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																		DESC:When you successfully charge and bull rush a creature while riding atop your floating disk, you can veer the disk into your target, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to moving the target. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against any attack of opportunity attempted against you when performing a bull rush in this way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:62
Spurn Gravity							KEY:Floating Disk Trick ~ Spurn Gravity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																		DESC:While astride your floating disk, you can fly higher than 5 feet above the ground. However, you must return to a location 5 feet above a stable surface before the end of your turn or fall. If you take damage from this fall, you fall prone atop your floating disk. As a swift action, you can also reduce the remaining duration of your floating disk to 1 round per level. For the remaining duration of the spell, your fly speed increases to 50 feet and your disk ignores all altitude limitations.
